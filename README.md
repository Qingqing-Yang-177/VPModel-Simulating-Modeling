## Simulation and Modeling of Variable Precision Model
# Modelling the Working memory resource allocation

This repository is a fork of the original repository from Yoo Aspen (https://github.com/aspenyoo/WM_resource_allocation).
I created this repository as the result of my simulation and modeling of the variable precision model based on Yoo's codes. I also write a documentation of a introduction of variable precision model, and my simulation and modeling practices as a review of the VP model, which i could share with u if u contact me by qy775@nyu.edu

The original parent repository is accompanied from Yoo AH's paper paper *Strategic allocation of working memory resource* by Yoo, Klyszejko, Curtis, & Ma (2018, Sci Reports). [\[link\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-34282-1.pdf)

# My contributions are:
- **qy_modelling results** contains results of my model simulation, parameter recovery, model comparison
- **simulate&model_QY.m** the codes that I made for 

# A brief description of the orginal repository organization (details are found within each file):
- **data/priority:** contains data for the first and second experiment. 
- **fits/priority:** contains model predictions for the first and second experiment. 
- **helperfunctions:** functions necessary for model fitting, plots, etc. 
- **model:** all functions necessary to fit any of the models to data. 
- **tutorial:** this contains files for a lab meeting tutorial. It may not be helpful for you. 
- **plots_for_pub.m:** recreate all plots in publication
- **stats_for_pub.m** redo stats reported in publication
